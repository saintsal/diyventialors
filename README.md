# DIY Ventiliators

We are expecting a shortage of mechanical breathing assistance for severe COVID-19 patients.

To save the lives of people who will not have access to a breathing apparatus, our goal is to make it possible for locals to construct their own using locally-available or standard parts.  We aim to do this by building a **library of DIY plans and designs** that others can improve, or build locally for fast response.  

We are focused on the fastest path to having a *just good enough* and *pruduceable* design on a country by country basis.
