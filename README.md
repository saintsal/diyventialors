# DIY Ventiliators

We are expecting a shortage of mechanical breathing assistance for sever COVID-19 patients.

To save the lives of people who will not have access to a breathing apparatus, our goal is to make it possible for locals to construct their own using locally-available or standard parts.  We aim to do this by building a **library of DIY plans and designs** that others can improve, or build locally for fast response.

# How this works


### If you have any design, mechanical or medical clinical experience, please register your interest and join a team.

**Step 1.  Join a team**
If you are a nurse, doctor, mechanical engineer or hardware hacker, add your name to this big list of people. [The sign up form is here](https://airtable.com/shr46cYDx5856dQcV) and takes about 2 minutes.

Then [review the list of people here](https://airtable.com/shrskx6uYDk1KqrvN), and get in touch with anyone that can help you or that you can help.

You can also review [the list of concepts](https://airtable.com/shr9r4QBrVtvTtrG8) to join those teams.

If you need help, please ask us.

**Step 2. Pick a goal**
Generally, designs will progress through 3 stages:

1. Concept
2. Prototype built
3. Tested by a medical professional

Based on where your team is best able to help, [you can pick ideas from the relevant stage of the design library](https://airtable.com/shrIHCO5Sm4SiAsx0) and try to progress them in your session, or work on your own ideas.

**Step 3. Meet that group over a video call session**  
Don't waste time.  Just jump on any kind of video call as a team and start working.  Ideally sessions are going to be 2-4 hours, but some may take a day.  Just make sure the session isn't longer than that because it's important to share your progress immediately after the session (so others can benefit and we all keep moving forward quickly.)

## The urgency

Even in places with fewer than 100 confirmed cases, the doubling speed of infection is every 2 days, which means if there are 20 confirmed cases now, there will be 327,000 in 28 days. (20 * 2^(28/2) If you account for the fact that the virus may have started spreading 10 days before the first confirmed case, then that number is 300 million, effectively saturating the population. (The theoratical maxium being described is 70% of the population.)

It is expected that 1% of cases will need mechanical breathing assistance, and in many countries there are only ~1,000 of those machines available.  For example, there are 1,400 in Bulgaria, where I live, making the maximum number of cases 140,000 or less, before doctors simply have to let people die.  If we are being practical, we should assume that time is coming before April -- but we can do somthing.

## We must work "exponentially" ourselves

There are other projects that are trying to mobilise people to do the same.  They are facing obstacles for a few reasons:

1. Because they are centralised groups, they are getting stuck with technical communication problems and other management problems because the organisers become the bottleneck.

2. They are closing off their information behind inaccessible chat groups, and not publishing their results openly, so people can't participate. Their successes are not being shared for others to work from.

3. They are aiming to find a single design they can manufacture and distribute, which will rule out good-enough designs that can be build locally, close to where they are needed.

To help solve this, we would like to build a repository of open, free designs for respiratory ventilators that can be built and assembled by local healthcare facilities around the world.

There will be no one true answer to this problem, and time is of the essence. **So this project aims to openly connect people so they can make small prototypes quickly, then share those designs with everyone else.**

That way, we'll all learn from each other faster, and every hospital in a ventilator shortage can pick the designs that make sense for them.

We're trying to keep this simple and open for now, avoiding any technical limitations by using easy to use, open-access communication, with a strategy of distribution first.  Share progress in small incremeents (or sprints for the designer out there.)  Use communication channels that others can access without any approvals or delays. Etc.


## How to help

## If you have facilitation skills
Your role is one of a connector.  Review the list of people, and help them form good teams.  Offer to help faciltate their video sessions so they produce results at the end of each and share them.  **SHIP IT** is the key. Any concept that gets to the next stage, or fails to with valuable lessons learned, will be immediately useful to the whole community.

Please, please, please do not make yourself a dependency in any way.  This will work best when every team and participant has fully agency to act on their own, feels empowered to do so, and doesn't need to wait on you for anything.  To make this process accelerator progress (instead of slow it down with beurocracy) the rule is: in each communication with anyone, offer something useful proactively, but without needing further communication by you.  You can always offer more support, but after every interaction with you, participants and teams should be independent.

I am avialable at **salim @ source.institute** if you have any questions or suggestions.
