# DIY Ventiliators

We are expecting a shortage of mechanical breathing assistance for severe COVID-19 patients.

To save the lives of people who will not have access to a breathing apparatus, our goal is to make it possible for locals to construct their own using locally-available or standard parts.  We aim to do this by building a **library of DIY plans and designs** that others can improve, or build locally for fast response.  

We are focused on the fastest path to having a *just good enough* and *pruduceable* design on a country by country basis. 

## The open source strategy
We want to prioritse designs that can be built  with locally-available parts, so they are quickly available and communities are empowered to react to need. Simple and basic funcationality is  more important than advanced features.  And we are not concerning ourselves with regulatory compliance.  In live or not-live situations, we think speed to availability and practical functionality are the only important aspects to work towards.  The regulatory aspects are more likely to be addressed if a design is a practical option and ready to produce.  We are following the [Good Samaritan Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Samaritan_law).



# What this project focuses on
The goal here is for people to connect independently and self-direct to design and test prototypes in short essions.  For the most part, we encourage people to find something they can do to contribute the verification efforts of the most prgressed designs. That means some duplication of effort, but overall gives us faster visibility of problems, and keeps people working on the thing that will address the shortage the fastest way possible.

This is going to be chaotic but we are providing two centralised resources to help people self-direct:

1. [An open list of volunteers.](https://airtable.com/shrskx6uYDk1KqrvN)  (or a [table view](https://airtable.com/shrskx6uYDk1KqrvN) )
2. [An open library of ventilator designs](https://airtable.com/shrIHCO5Sm4SiAsx0), with medical feedback and contruction notes from volunteers.  It is organised by progress level, so you can choose what to work on more easily.

Time is of the essense, so it's better to start working now, and add help as you go.  In some cases small interdiciplinary groups make sense, so create online video chat sessions where they do their own "mini-hackathon" in order to generate concepts, or progress them through prototype and testing.   See below for how to get help when you need it.


# What should I do now?

**Step 1.  Add yourself to the open list of volunteers**

<iframe class="airtable-embed" src="https://airtable.com/embed/shrm2y1bUzG7KZYHu?backgroundColor=red&viewControls=on" frameborder="0" onmousewheel="" width="100%" height="533" style="background: transparent; border: 1px solid #ccc;"></iframe>

If you have any design, hardware, mechanical or medical clinical experience, people will need you. [The sign up form is here](https://airtable.com/shr46cYDx5856dQcV) and takes about 2 minutes. Then you can join [the chat group here.](https://discord.gg/Xu8Uzj)

**Step 2. Get to work on something**

Please pick a design to work on.  Ideally, you can work in short sessions, either evaluating a design on buildability or medical effectiveness. If you can improve the design in any way, that's great too. Please make all suggestions and updates openly in the [design library](https://airtable.com/embed/shrIHCO5Sm4SiAsx0/tbl7hMA18kmI63JDk?backgroundColor=red&viewControls=on&blocks=hide) or the design's respective "wiki" page which is a google doc linked from the database. 

We are asking everyone to self-direct, and report progress openly, so we do not get overwhelmed by coordination.  We'll post regular updates on overall progress and areas where help is needed.  Please get in touch with anyone that can help you or that you can help.

When choosing a design to work on, **please priortise the shortest path to producible devices, which likely means working on the designs at later stages.**

**Connnect with others for help and guidance as soon as you need it.**
If you need help from a specific skill, [ask a volunteer connector](https://airtable.com/shrkvMYer4BoEoQfh). If you need facilatation help, [ask one of these volunteer facilitators](https://airtable.com/shrsgPfmZ5llNutHi).

It's also worth quickly asking on the [chat group](https://discord.gg/Xu8Uzj).

If you have any ideas for a device, and would like to post them in order for potential teammates to find you, [submit them here](https://airtable.com/shrzYj5WNlmQzssEI)  They will appear on the left, in the idea column.

**Use video sessions in small groups if needed**  

To progress quickly, sometimes "show" is better than "tell." Jump on any kind of video call nd start working over the open line. (If you're having connection trouble, [whereby.com](http://whereby.com) is a fast video chat most people can access within a minute or so. ) 

Ideally design sessions are going to be 2-4 hours, but some may take a day.  Just make sure the session isn't longer than that because it's important to share your progress immediately after the session (so others can benefit and we all keep moving forward quickly.)

At the beginning of each session, **nominate a note-taker who will share your progress at the end of the session.**

To get an idea of this, [click here to see the submission form at the end of each session](https://airtable.com/shrIHCO5Sm4SiAsx0) and/or post the approprate wiki page for the design.  You can find that link when clicking on the card in the design library.



# FAQ

## How urgent is this?
Some countries already have respirator shortages, and even countries with fewer than 100 cases now should be prepared for the same problem in a matter of weeks.  Here's why.

Even in places with fewer than 100 confirmed cases, the doubling speed of infection is every 2 days, which means if there are 20 confirmed cases now, there will be 327,000 in 28 days. (20 * 2^(28/2) If you account for the fact that the virus may have started spreading 10 days before the first confirmed case, then that number is 300 million, effectively saturating the population. (The theoratical maxium being described is 70% of the population.)

It is expected that a significant percentage of cases will need mechanical breathing assistance, and in many countries there are only ~1,000 of those machines available.  For example, there are 1,400 in Bulgaria, where I live, making the maximum number of cases 140,000 or less, before doctors simply have to let people die.  If we are being practical, we should assume that time is coming before April -- but we can do something.

## How is this different from other "hackathons"?

There are other projects that are trying to mobilise people to do the same.  They are facing obstacles for a few reasons:

1. Because they are centralised groups, they are getting stuck with technical communication problems and other management problems because the organisers become the bottleneck.

2. They are closing off their information behind inaccessible chat groups, and not publishing their results openly and frequently, so people can't participate. Their successes are not being shared for others to work from.

3. They are aiming to find a single design they can manufacture and distribute, which will rule out good-enough designs that can be build locally, close to where they are needed.

To help solve this, we would like to build a repository of open, free designs for respiratory ventilators that can be built and assembled by local healthcare facilities around the world.

There will be no one true answer to this problem, and time is of the essence. 

**So this project aims to openly connect people so they can make small prototypes quickly, then share those designs with everyone else.** Openness, and working in small increments while sharing and building a common library.  This enables people to start now, and their work helps others as they do it.

That way, we'll all learn from each other faster, and every hospital in a ventilator shortage can pick the designs that make sense for them.

We're trying to keep this simple and open, avoiding any technical limitations by using easy to use, open-access communication. 

We share progress in small incremeents (or sprints for the designers out there.)  We use communication channels that others can access without any approvals or delays. We share our work and databases in the open to keep things moving.

[The entire database is online here](https://airtable.com/shrUS6Zb9JP8eEZk3) for any project to use.  

## If you have facilitation skills
Your role is one of a connector.  Review the list of people, and help them form good teams.  Offer to help faciltate their video sessions so they produce results at the end of each and share them.  **SHIP IT** is the key. Any concept that gets to the next stage, or fails to with valuable lessons learned, will be immediately useful to the whole community.

Please, please, please do not make yourself a dependency in any way.  This will work best when every team and participant has full agency to act on their own, feels empowered to do so, and doesn't need to wait on you for anything. Offer something useful proactively, but without needing further communication by you. You can always offer more support, but after every interaction with you, participants and teams should be independent.

I am avialable at **salim @ source.institute** if you have any questions or suggestions, or find me in [our chat group]((https://discord.gg/Xu8Uzj).
